; PURPOSE:
;  This procedure attempts to bracket the minimum of a one dimensional
;  function. A minimum is bracketed by three points ax, bx, cx, if:
;    1) bx is between ax and cx
;    2) f(b) < f(a) and f(b) < f(c)
;  In this situation, provided the function is continuous, there is
;  guaranteed to be a local minimum in between a and c.
;
;  The procedure is fairly robust in finding _some_ minimum, provided
;  one exists. However, there is no guarantee that it will find the
;  minimum closest to the starting location. 
;
;  The algorithm is lifted from Numerical Recipes, with some attempt
;  to make the base cases a bit clearer

; CATEGORY:
;  Numerical Recipes
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;  bracket, func, a, b, ax, bx, cx, fa, fb, fc, /verbose, _extra =
;  extra
;
; INPUTS:
;  func: A string giving the name of the 1D function to bracket. The
;        function must have the following calling sequence:
;           function func, x, _extra = extra
;        it may declare extra keywords, which can be supplied to
;        bracket and passed along to the function
;
;  a: The first trial abscissa
;  b: The second trial abscissa. The search for the minimum starts at
;     a and b, and proceeds downhill. Note that (a-b) should be
;     scaled, if possible, to match the scale of the wiggles in the
;     function. This will help in finding the nearest minimum
;
; OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
;  ax: Named variable to hold the first abscissa of the bracket
;  bx: Named variable to hold the second abscissa of the bracket
;  cx: Named variable to hold the final abscissa of the bracket
;  fa: Named variable to hold f(ax)
;  fb: Named variable to hold f(bx)
;  fc: Named variable to hold f(cx)
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;  _extra: Any extra keywords will be passed to FUNC
;  verbose: Set to an integer to control the amount of textual output
;  to produce (see VERBIAGE procedure for details) 
;
; PROCEDURE:
;  The procedure is adapted from Numerical Recipes, 3rd ed., page
;  491. It always keeps track of three x values (abc).  It repeatedly
;  steps downhill. At each iteration, it approximates the 3 most
;  recent points as a parabola, and extrapolates to the parabola's min
;  (if it exists). If parabolic extrapolation doesn't work (because
;  the points are nearly co-linear or concave down), it just takes a
;  moderately larger step than last time. It stops when the function
;  starts increasing again.

   ;- SUMMARY OF POSSIBILITES:
   ;- 1) ax, bx, cx are fit by a very steep parabola. Expected to be 
   ;-    numerically unstable. Parabola isn't used. (pitfall 1)
   ;- 2) ax, bx, cx are nearly colinear or concave down. Parabolic 
   ;-    extrapolation won't work. (pitfall 2)
   ;- 3) Parabola minimum isn't finite. Abort (pitfall 3)
   ;- 4) buc is a bracket (case 1a)
   ;- 5) abu is a bracket (case 1b)
   ;- 6) u between b and c, but not a good point.
   ;-    step beyond c and try again (case 1c)
   ;- 7) bcu is a bracket (case 2a)
   ;- 8) bcu is new abc (case 2b)
   ;- 9) f(b) eventually < f(c) (end of while statement).
   ;-    abc is the bracket.
