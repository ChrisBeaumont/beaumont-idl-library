; PURPOSE:
;  mcmc_multi is a subclass of the mcmc class to create markov chain
;  monte carlo simulations on multiple chains simultaneously.
;
;  One of IDL's principal weaknesses is that, since it is an
;  interpreted scripting language, it is much slower than compiled
;  languages for repetitive tasks like looping. The mcmc_multi class
;  tries to mitigate this problem by vectorizing the mcmc code. In
;  this class, multiple chains are run simultaneously and, assuming
;  that the code which generates and evaluates trial links is
;  vectorized well, this may be substantially faster than running one
;  long mcmc chain.
;
;  To use this class, the user must supply ARRAYS for the seed and
;  data variables when initializing the object. Each element in the
;  array represents the seed/data for a particular chain. The final
;  set of chains fetched from the getChain method will have nchain
;  columns and nstep rows.
;
;  As with the mcmc class, the user must also override the
;  logTargetDistribution and selectTrial methods in a subclass of
;  mcmc_multi. These methods have the same signatures as in a normal
;  mcmc object, but the inputs and outputs must now be arrays, not
;  scalars. These objects should be written in a vectorized fashion,
;  otherwise mcmc_multi will probably have no speed bost over mcmc.
;
;  Some quick testing showed that mcmc_multi was about a factor of 2
;  slower than mcmc when run using only 1 chain, but was 10x faster
;  when comparing 100 chains to 1 chain with 100x as many steps.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;  October 2009: Written by Chris Beaumont, adapted from the mcmc
;                class.
;  December 2009: Added tracking of maximum posterior
