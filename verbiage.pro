; PURPOSE:
;  This procedure proivdes a mechanism to report messages of various
;  priorities within programs. A message is passed to verbiage, along
;  with the message's priority and the maximum priority to report. If the
;  message priority is equal to or less than the required report
;  priority, the message is printed to the terminal. Otherwise, the
;  program exits quietly.
;
;  For example, consider the following program:
;   pro talk, verbose = verbose
;     verbiage, 'report level is 1', 1, verbose
;     verbiage, 'report level is 2', 2, verbose
;   end
;
;   This program would produce the following messages:
;    IDL> talk, verbose =  0
;          [nothing happens]
;    IDL> talk, verbose = 1
;          'report level is 1'
;    IDL> talk, verbose = 2
;          'report level is 1'
;          'report level is 2'
;    IDL> talk
;          [nothing happens]
;
;  Note that, in the last case, verbiage handles the case where
;  'verbose' is undefined. This is nice, since keywords like 'verbose'
;  are usually optional.
;
;  The program is designed to facilitate a hierarchy of messages,
;  which the user can switch between. For example, verboose = 0 will
;  turn off all messages for running in batch mode. verbose = 4 might
;  produce very detailed output for debugging purposes.
;
;  When using verbiage in programs, I recommend the following
;  hierarchy for message priorities:
;   0: No messages have priority of 0
;   1: Messages indicate program failure
;   2: Messages tersely summarize program results
;   3: Detailed summary / progress report of a program
;   4: Debugging messages

; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;  verbiage, msg, msg_lvl, report_lvl
;
; INPUTS:
;  msg: The message to (perhaps) print
;  msg_lvl: The priority of the message (see the recommendation above) 
;  report_lvl: The maximum priority to report. This is usually
;              provided by the end user, through a keyword like
;              verbose. The program gracefully handles the case where
;              report_lvl is missing. This means that, if report_lvl
;              is passed a value of a user defined keyword (like
;              verbose, for example), you don't need to check
;              to make sure that keyword was defined.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;  The message is printed if report_lvl >= msg_lvl
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;  June 2009: Written by Chris Beaumont
;  December 2009: Messages are indented proportional to the
;                 calling function's depth in the stack.
